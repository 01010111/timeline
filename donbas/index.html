			<h1>Russia blackmails Yanukovych to discourage joining EU at EU summit at Vilnius.</h1>
			<quote>Jovita Neliupšiene, foreign policy aide to President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania, said Yanukovych had called her before announcing he was ditching the EU pact, arguing that the pressure from Moscow was irresistible.<br/><br/>Yanukovych and Putin had a secret meeting last week. The Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers then met in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday.<br/><br/>"Ukraine could not withstand the economic pressure and blackmail. It was threatened with restricted imports of its goods to Russia, particularly from companies in eastern Ukraine, which accommodates the greater share of its industry and employs hundreds of thousands of people. Calculations suggest this would lead to billions in losses. These causes behind the decision were specified by President Yanukovych in the telephone conversation with the president earlier this week," Neliupšiene told a Baltic news agency.</quote>

			<h1>Euromaidan protesters respond to Yanukovych abandoning EU trade deal.</h1>
			<quote>President Viktor Yanukovych “ignored” the will of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who called on him to take Ukraine into a European future that “millions of Ukrainians want…he is taking the nation into the past.”The resolution proposed the following:<br/><br/>1. Form a coordinating committee to communicate with the European community.<br/><br/>2. To state that the president, parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers aren’t capable of carrying out a geopolitically strategic course of development for the state and calls on Yanukovych’s resignation.<br/><br/>3. Demand the cessation of political repressions against EuroMaidan activists, students, civic activists and opposition leaders.</quote>

			<h1>Journalists targeted by Berkut (Ukrainian Special Police).</h1>
			<quote>More than 50 journalists were injured during 3 days of fierce confrontation at the border of the government quarter. After targeted, in their opinion, attacks, reporters began to take off their vests with the inscription "press" , according to the story of TSN.<br/><br/>From now on, journalists no longer consider themselves "untouchable" when covering events.<br/><br/>They are threatened, shot at - both by accident and on purpose. And for some, they simply break and smash the equipment.</quote>
