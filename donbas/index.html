			<h1>Russia blackmails Yanukovych to discourage joining EU at EU summit at Vilnius.</h1>
			<quote>Jovita Neliupšiene, foreign policy aide to President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania, said Yanukovych had called her before announcing he was ditching the EU pact, arguing that the pressure from Moscow was irresistible.<br/><br/>Yanukovych and Putin had a secret meeting last week. The Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers then met in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday.<br/><br/>"Ukraine could not withstand the economic pressure and blackmail. It was threatened with restricted imports of its goods to Russia, particularly from companies in eastern Ukraine, which accommodates the greater share of its industry and employs hundreds of thousands of people. Calculations suggest this would lead to billions in losses. These causes behind the decision were specified by President Yanukovych in the telephone conversation with the president earlier this week," Neliupšiene told a Baltic news agency.</quote>

Form a coordinating committee to communicate with the European community.<br/><br/>2. To state that the president, parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers aren’t capable of carrying out a geopolitically strategic course of development for the state and calls on Yanukovych’s resignation.<br/><br/>3.

After targeted, in their opinion, attacks, reporters began to take off their vests with the inscription "press" , according to the story of TSN.<br/><br/>From now on, journalists no longer consider themselves "untouchable" when covering events.<br/><br/>They are threatened, shot at - both by accident and on purpose. And for some, they simply break and smash the equipment.</quote>

He said he had flown to Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine after threats to his safety, with his car being shot at.<br/><br/>“I am threatened all the time with ultimatums. I am not planning to flee the country. I am not planning to resign. I am the legally elected president,” Mr Yanukovich said.</quote>

			<h1>Russian forces take over parliamentary and other administrative buildings in Crimea.</h1>
			<quote>Despite what Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a recent press conference, Crimea was not seized by a local paramilitary “self-defense” force but rather by a few thousand well-equipped and heavily armed Russian troops. The forces came mainly from the Southern Military District, which borders Ukraine and the North Caucasus, and they had extensive support from the 15,000 soldiers of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.</quote>

			<quote>How that was achieved under the leadership of Sergei Aksyonov, 41, a Russian separatist whose political party won 4 percent of the vote at the parliamentary election in 2010, was a master class in vote rigging and intimidation, according to several opposition lawmakers.<br/><br/>"It was all a great spectacle, a tragic spectacle," said Leonid Pilunsky, one of a number of regional lawmakers who say a vote behind closed doors to install Aksyonov was fixed and key decisions were taken before anyone could respond.<br/><br/>Moscow says Crimea is in the grip of a home-spun uprising, a popular response to the revolt in Kiev which ousted Ukraine's Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich.<br/><br/>The next morning before dawn, armed men seized the building, and from then on, journalists were excluded and it was not possible to verify whether a quorum was reached. Lawmakers had their phones confiscated at the door.</quote>

			<h1>Russian paratroopers disguised as Berkut police forces join assault on Crimean Parliament</h1>
			<quote>Besides 'little green men', there was also a constantly exaggerated theme of local self-defense forces, reinforced by former Ukrainian 'siloviki' (i.e. former employees of the police and special units, who fled Ukraine after the collapse of Yanukovych) all together.<br/><br/>But “marching columns” of defectors from the former Ukrainian police in fact consisted entirely from the disguised Russian servicemen.<br/><br/>Thus, the masquerade of Russian paratroopers from Ulyanovsk 31st Brigade in Crimea, disguised in Ukrainian uniform, is only part of the scenario to impose the idea of a 'civil war' in Ukraine while in fact it is a war organized by the Russian Federation. Now we see a sequel of this scenario in Donbas.</quote>
